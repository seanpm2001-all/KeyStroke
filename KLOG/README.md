# KLOG

## anti Key LOGger

KLOG is an anti-keylogging protection suite for KeyStroke that expands its purpose past being just a joke program. It is the first expansion of the scope of this project.

## What is a keylogger

A keylogger is a program that tracks every key you press and sends it to someone else. This is considered spyware.

## Functionality

KLOG is not ready yet, it needs a lot of development. The major challenges it faces includes:

> * RootKit detection and blocking of KeyLoggers at an OS level (CPU Ring 0 / BIOS)

> * Finding a keylogger and stopping it in its tracks
